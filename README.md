# Smart-Surveillance-System-Helmet-Detection-
Smart Surveillance System(Helmet Detection)

This project is based on Image Processing and Machine Learning techniques. The project takes video as an input and detects people riding bike without wearing helmets. Technologies used are:-

1. ImageAI Library-
        ImageAI is a python library built to empower developers, reseachers and students to build applications and systems with         self-contained Deep Learning and Computer Vision capabilities using simple and few lines of code.
        
        The Official GitHub Repository of ImageAI is https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI
        
2. YOLO algorithm-
        YOLO (You Only Look Once) real-time object detection algorithm, which is one of the most effective object detection             algorithms that also encompasses many of the most innovative ideas coming out of the computer vision research                   community. Object detection is a critical capability of autonomous vehicle technology. It’s an area of computer vision         that’s exploding and working so much better than just a few years ago.
